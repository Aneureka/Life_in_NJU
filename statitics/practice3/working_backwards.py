"""
A 95% confidence interval for a population mean, u, is given as (18.985, 21.015).
This confidence interval is based on a simple random samples of 36 observations.
Calculate the sample mean and standard deviation.
Assume that all conditions necessary for inference are satisfied.
Use the t-distribution in any calculations.
Output:[mean, standard deviation], accurate to the second decimal place
